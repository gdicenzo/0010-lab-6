The **Portmanteaugram** is a program that creates a basic portmanteau from your name and another word of your choice. The portmanteau will include your name without the last syllable and the other word without the first syllable. It parses the inputs by identifying syllables by searching for vowels.

*Note: Because syllables are identified using vowels, a syllable won't be parsed correctly if it ends in a consonant*

Example: `Tianyi` + `apple` = `Tiaapple`, *not* `Tianapple`

## How to Use The Program
1. Run **portmanteaugram.py** in your interpreter of choice: `python3 portmanteaugram.py`
2. Input your first name
3. Input another word of your choice
4. Finish using the program because that's all it is
