The **Portmanteaugram** is a program that creates a basic portmanteau from your name and another word of your choice. The portmanteau will include your name without the last syllable and the other word without the first syllable. It parses the inputs by identifying syllables by searching for vowels.

*Note: Because syllables are identified using vowels, a syllable wouldn't be parsed correctly if it ended in a consonant*
Example: `Tianyi` + `apple` = `Tiaapple`, *not* `Tianapple`

## How to Use The Program
1. Run **portmanteaugram.py** in your interpreter of choice
2. Input your first name
3. Input another word of your choice
4. Finish using the program because that's all it is

## How to Contribute
If you'd like to contribute to the program, feel free to make additions and improvements to any facet of the code that you like.
